Sequence Pad

Sequence Pad is a web application that allows users to create audio sequences by selecting 
one of six different sounds, then using that sound and corresponding color to activate cells
on the sequence board. Users are able to activate the continuous loop by selecting the play button/icon.  
Users also have the ability to pause and clear their compositions.  As long as a user is registered 
and signed in, they will be able to save their song to our database, so they are able to load 
the sequence board to hear or change at any time.
