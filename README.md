Sequence Pad is a web application that allows users to create audio sequences
by selecting one of six different sounds, then using that sound/color to activate
the sequence board. Users are able to play, pause, clear, save, and load their previously
composed sequence, as long as they are signed in.

This project utilized the following technologies:
* Javascript
* Jquery
* Ruby on Rails
* Sass - for styling
* PostgreSQL - database
* Amazon S3 - audio and image storage
* Digital Ocean - cloud hosting
* Rspec - testing
* Bcrypt Gem - for keeping passwords confidential
